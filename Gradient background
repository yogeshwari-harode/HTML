	<h1> “Stopping by Woods On a Snowy Evening” <br>by Robert Frost</h1>
	<div class="a" >
<em><b>Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
His house is in the village though;<br>
He will not see me stopping here<br>
To watch his woods fill up with snow.<br>
My little horse must think it queer<br>
To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
The darkest evening of the year.<br>
He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
The only other sound’s the sweep<br>
Of easy wind and downy flake.<br>
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
But I have promises to keep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep.<br>
</b></em>
